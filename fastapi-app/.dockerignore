# FastAPI specific (if you use specific tooling or generated files)
# You might want to add specific directories or files here if your FastAPI setup
# generates them and you don't want them in version control.
# For example, if you use Uvicorn and it creates a log directory:
# uvicorn_logs/

# SQLAlchemy specific (if you manage migrations with Alembic)
# The 'versions' directory is where Alembic stores migration scripts.
# It's generally good practice to commit these, but if you have a reason
# not to, uncomment the line below.
